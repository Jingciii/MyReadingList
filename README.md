# MyReadingList
Reading list for research papers in Data Science field. **Keep Updating**!

## Motivation

Inspired by [Andrew Ng's advice on building a Machine Learning career](https://blog.usejournal.com/advice-on-building-a-machine-learning-career-and-reading-research-papers-by-prof-andrew-ng-f90ac99a0182), I feel learning from reading in Data Science really necessary. Also, I found it super useful during preparing paper presentation within company teams where I'm doing co-op. I've learned a lot through reading and summarizing and the whole process could have been enjoyable and less painfull if I did not consider it too difficult and high-level. So I decided to make it on a regular basis. 


## Basic Requirements for each Paper

 * I do not want myself end up reading for reading. After finishing one paper, I should at lease have to be able to fill the following template 

```
- What did the author(s) try to accomplish?
- What were the key elements of the approach(s)?
- List the concepts/techniques that are new to me and highlight whatever I feel necessary to put into my skill set if there is any.
- Thoughts and questions
```

 * Pick one paper and write comments/reviews notes in more detail (like a tech post) at least biweekly

*If it's simply answering questions in first bullet, mark as [summary]. If containing second case, mark as [note]*
