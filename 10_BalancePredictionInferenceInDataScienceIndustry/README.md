1. What did the author(s) try to accomplish?

 In this paper, the author offer a perspective on the balance of *prediction* and *inference* for data science in business setting. Through a textural analysis of abstract from academic papers, this paper demonstrate the trends for prediction-oriented and inference-oriented elements in difference research categories and the results suggested that discussion of statistical inference is increasingly concentrated in certain subcategories and move away from from subcategories where it used to be more prevalent. Finally, the author argued the value of inference should not be overlooked and discussed how data science teams are integrated in business.

2. What were the key elements of the approach(s)?

 - From experience in *entertainment* industry of data science aspect and the incorporation across team with experts from different field.
 - Making use of academic papers, derive insights by simply word frequency of target keywords and their conjugations and analyze w.r.t to independent and relative change.


3.  List the concepts/techniques that are new to me and highlight whatever I feel necessary to put into my skill set if there is any.

 Mostly some advice for data science career:
  - Statistical inference is important in data science industry regarding to recognizing effects of certain features
  - Communication should be viewed as an integral part of an outcome from a balanced model development process

4.  Thoughts and questions

 This paper is not about the introduction of some fantastic technical method but some thoughts and recommendations on the Data Science industry. It also is worthwhile to launch and interpret some of data science projects from both prediction and inference point of views
