1. What did the author(s) try to accomplish?

 To explore the role of soft skills in job advertisements, especially the relationship with gender stereotypically traits. To some extent, they verified the conclusion from some previous studies that not all types of soft skills are valued equally and skills that are perceived as "female" are found to be associated with wage penalties.

2. What were the key elements of the approach(s)?

 - The process of deriving and detecting soft skills form a bunch of job descriptions:
 
  		- crowd sourcing 
  		- soft skills clustering
  - Normalizing salary reward to reflect the strength of given soft skill

  


3.  List the concepts/techniques that are new to me and highlight whatever I feel necessary to put into my skill set if there is any.

 Nothing technically new, but feel the need to develop some soft skills



4.  Thoughts and questions

 - how did the soft skills extracted from the job descriptions? -- crowdsourcing
 - By what criterion did they make the final clustering for soft skills
 - I like the part that the authors conclude from locally and globally perspective that not only does one potentially get paid less if one is carrying out tasks connoted as being female but occupations carried out mainly by women are also advertised making use of those skills that come about with wage penalties
 - I feel it not convincing only study w.r.t to soft skills and their gender effects. I agree that other factors such as experience and title make some effect and in the paper they did pretty well to control variables and indeed noticeable outcomes are statistically significant, but I look for few more experiments considering those factors.
